Usage

Overview
--------

*court-scraper* provides a command-line tool and underlying Python library
that can be used to scrape data about court cases.  The command-line tool supports
basic search by case numbers. The Python library offers a wider range of options
for more advanced use cases (e.g. filtering search results by case type).

Our project focuses on scraping data from platforms used by county-level courts. 
These platforms vary in features. Some only offer basic search by party or case number,
whereas others support advanced search by one or more parameters such as date range and case type.

Wherever possible, *court-scraper* attempts to provide support for search by:

- **date range** - to enable automated discovery of new cases and backfilling of previous cases
- **case type** - to enable more targeted scrapes in combination with date range
- **case number** - to enable ongoing updates of open cases

The library is currently focused on acquring raw file artifacts (e.g. HTML and JSON files containing case data).
*court-scraper* does not automate the extraction and standardization of data from these raw files.

.. note:: We hope to eventually provide tools to help with data extraction and standardization. However,
          due to the wide variability of case types even within a single platform, this effort remains
          on our long-term roadmap. We welcome :ref:`contributions <contributing>` on this front!


.. _find a site:

Find a court to scrape
-----------------------

Before you can start scraping court records, you must first pinpoint
a county of interest and check whether we currently support it.

Use the command-line tool's :ref:`info sub-command <cli info>` to list currently supported counties.

If you don't see the state or county you're targeting, it's worth checking out our `Issue tracker`_ to
see if it's on the roadmap. In some cases, we may be actively working on adding support for your jurisdiction. We also
have a stable of scrapers that were written by others for project-specific purposes and contributed
to our project for integration into our more general framework. We can provide access to these
"one-off" scrapers for your customization, even if we have not yet integrated them into `court-scraper`.

.. _place id:

Place IDs
---------

*court-scraper* requires searches to target courts/jurisdictions in specific counties. Every jurisdiction supported
by the framework has a so-called *Place ID*. These unique identifiers are in "snake case" format
(i.e. lower case with underscores): :code:`<state_postal>_<county_name>`.

For example, the *Place ID* for Tulsa, Oklahoma is :code:`ok_tulsa`.

Whether working with the :ref:`CLI` or :ref:`Custom scripts`, you'll need to identify the `Place ID` for the
target jurisdiction. You can use the command-line tool's :ref:`info sub-command <cli info>` to
find the `Place ID` for your jurisdiction.


.. _cli:

Command line
------------

.. note:: Before using the command-line tool, check out the :ref:`install docs <install>` 
   and read up on :ref:`finding a court site to scrape <find a site>`.

The command-line tool helps pinpoint counties currently supported by *court-scraper* 
and enables scraping case files by number.

Use the :code:`--help` flag to view available sub-commands::

  court-scraper --help

.. _cli info:

Info command
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :code:`info` sub-command lists the currently supported counties::

  court-scraper info

.. note:: See :ref:`find a site` for advice if your jurisdiction is not among those listed.


Case number search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *court-scraper* CLI's :code:`search` sub-command is the primary way to gather
case details from a county court site. You can use the tool's :code:`--help`
flag to get details on available options::

  court-scraper search --help

The :code:`search` sub-command supports scraping by case number. It requires two parameters:

- :code:`--place-id` or :code:`-p` - A combination of state postal and county name in "snake case" (e.g. `ok_tulsa`). The :ref:`Place ID <place id>` can be obtained by using the :ref:`info sub-command <cli info>`.

- :code:`--case-number` or :code:`-c` - A single case number to scrape.

Here's an example search for Tulsa, Oklahoma::

  # Scrape case details by place ID and case number
  court-scraper search --place-id ok_tulsa --case-number CJ-2021-2045

To search for more than one case at a time, use the :code:`--case-numbers-file` (or :code:`-f`) flag
with a text file containing case numbers on separate lines.

For example, if you create a *case_numbers.txt* file with the below case numbers::

  # case_numbers.txt
  CJ-2021-2045
  CJ-2021-2046

You can then search using the *case_numbers.txt* file::

  court-scraper search --place-id ok_tulsa --case-numbers-file case_numbers.txt


Browser mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scrapers that use `Selenium <https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/>`_ to drive a web browser
by default run in "headless" mode (i.e. the browser will not run visibly). In order
to run a Selenium-based scraper with the browser, which can be helpful for debugging, use
the :code:`--with-browser` flag::

  court-scraper search --with-browser --place-id ok_tulsa --case-number CJ-2021-2045


File storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Files scraped by the :code:`search` sub-command are saved to a :ref:`standard <default cache dir>`  -- but :ref:`configurable <customize cache dir>` -- location 
in the user's home directory, based on the court's :ref:`Place ID <place id>` (:code:`~/.court-scraper/cache/<place_id>` on Linux/Mac).

For example, HTML files scraped for Tulsa, Oklahoma are stored in :code:`~/.court-scraper/cache/ok_tulsa`.

Metadata db
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :code:`search` sub-command stores basic metadata about scraped cases in a SQLite database
located in the :ref:`standard cache directory <default cache dir>`: :code:`~/.court-scraper/cases.db`.

The database can be helpful for quickly checking which cases have been scraped.

It stores the following fields:

* ``created`` (*datetime*) - The date and time of the case was initially scraped.
* ``udpated`` (*datetime*) - The date and time of last scrape for the case.
* ``place_id`` (*str*) - The state postal and county name in "snake case" (e.g. *ok_tulsa*).
* ``number`` (*str*) - The case number.
* ``filing_date`` (*date*) - The filing date of the case (if available).
* ``status`` (*str*) - Case status (if available).

.. _custom scripts:

Custom scripts
--------------

*court-scraper* provides an importable Python package for users who are comfortable creating their 
own scripts. The Python package provides access to a wider variety of features for
added flexibility and more advanced scenarios such as searching by date and filtering by case type.

.. note:: Court websites offer different search functionality, so it's important to review
   the site and its corresponding Site class (and search methods) in this library to get a sense 
   of supported features.


Scrape case details by number
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you :ref:`install <install>` *court-scraper* and
:ref:`find a site to scrape <find a site>`, you're ready to begin
using the ``court_scraper`` Python package.

Create an instance of :code:`Site` by passing it the :ref:`Place ID <place id>` for
the jurisdiction. Then call the :code:`search` method with one or more case numbers::

  from court_scraper import Site
  site = Site('ok_tulsa')
  case_numbers=['CJ-2021-1904', 'CJ-2021-1905']
  results = site.search(case_numbers=case_numbers)

.. note:: :py:class:`Site <court_scraper.site.Site>` provides a generic interface to simplify import and configuration
   of platform-specific Site classes, such as :py:class:`court_scraper.platforms.oscn.site.Site`.
   Platform Site classes typically have varying options for initialization and search, so it's a good
   idea to review their options when using this generic Site class.

.. _scrape by date:

Scrape by date
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some court sites support date-based search. In such cases, you can use the platform's :code:`Site.search_by_date` method 
to scrape data for one or more days.

By default, :code:`search_by_date` only gathers case metadata (e.g. case numbers, filing dates, status, etc.) that 
typically appear on a results page after performing a search.

.. note:: See :ref:`below <scrape details>` for details on scraping case detail file artifacts (e.g. HTML, JSON, etc.).

To scrape case metadata for the current day::

  from court_scraper import Site
  site = Site('ok_tulsa')
  results = site.search_by_date()

To search a range of dates, use the :code:`start_date` and :code:`end_date` arguments.
Their values must be strings of the form :code:`YYYY-MM-DD`. The below code scrapes metadata
for cases filed in Tulsa, Oklahoma during January 2021::

  from court_scraper import Site
  site = Site('ok_tulsa')
  results = site.search_by_date(start_date='2021-01-01', end_date='2021-01-31')

.. _scrape details:

Scrape case details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Court sites typically provide more detailed case information on separate pages devoted to a case.
Depending on the site, these pages can include:

- Case type
- Case status
- Litigant information (i.e. names and addresses)
- Judge name(s)
- Events related to the case (e.g. filings and decisions)

Links to case detail pages are listed on a results page after conducting a search.
These are typically HTML, but may be JSON or other file formats depending on the site.
 
By default, :code:`search_by_date` only scrapes metadata from search results pages (as described in :ref:`Scrape by date`).

To scrape case detail files, pass the :code:`case_details=True` keyword argument::

  from court_scraper import Site
  site = Site('ok_tulsa')
  results = site.search_by_date(
      start_date='2021-01-01',
      end_date='2021-01-31',
      case_details=True # Fetches case detail files
  )

.. filter case type:

Filter by case type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some court sites support a variety of parameters for more targeted filtering of
search results. These filters can be useful for more surgical scrapes, and in scenarios
where a site truncates results. If a site limits search results to 500 records, for example, 
scraping in a more targeted way with filters can help stay under that cap.


To determine if a site supports case-type filtering, you should review the court's website
and the corresponding :code:`Site` class in *court-scraper*.

For example, the Wisconsin court system's `Advanced Search`_ page
offers a variety of additional search parameters. In *court-scraper*, the site's
corresponding :py:meth:`search_by_date <court_scraper.platforms.wicourts.site.Site.search_by_date>` method
supports a :code:`case_types` argument that accepts a list of one or more case types.

.. note:: For Wisconsin, these case types are two-letter, upper-case codes that can be found by 
   examining the source code for the *Case types* select menu on the `Advanced Search`_ page.

Here's a sample usage that searches for civil (CV) and small claims (SC) cases
on July 1, 2021 in Milwaukee, WI::

  from court_scraper import Site
  site = Site('wi_milwaukee')
  results = site.search_by_date(
      start_date='2021-07-01',
      end_date='2021-07-01',
      case_types=['CV', 'SC'] # Civil and Small Claims case types
  )
